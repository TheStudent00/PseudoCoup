# log_8 — WFL → PseudoUI conversion: complete (30 screens)

Date: 2026-06-23 (updated)
Type: progress log. Pairs with log_5 (plan), log_6 (kit build spec), log_7 (kit complete).

## Where it stands

**30 of ~30 WFL screens converted — the full app**, each rendered by the ONE
PseudoFlutter kit on both paths (Flutter ship + Kivy debug) from the WFL re-skin token
profile (`tokens.wfl.json`) — the kit code is unchanged across themes; only the token
data differs. Golden suite: **65/65 green** (gate on the real exit code, not a piped
tail). The write-once → render-anywhere thesis is demonstrated end-to-end across a real
~30-screen production app.

"3-way" = diffed against a screencap of the **real WFL app** on the `WFL_Compare_AVD`
Android emulator. "2-way" = Flutter↔Kivy source-faithful (the screen is first-run or
deep in navigation; the Android leg is pending, not skipped).

## The methodology that worked

Per screen: **read the Compose source (and/or screencap the real screen) → assemble
from the kit → render both engines → diff.** The verification loop (Flutter golden +
Kivy `export_to_png` under xvfb + `tools/sidebyside.py`) is mechanical; the structural
assembly is the judgment (see "why not mechanical" below).

## The kit converged — then grew slowly and deliberately

Screens 14–26 add **at most one small leaf each**, and several add none. The leaves
added this stretch, each genuinely reused:

- **info_card** — a WflCard list card: heading (+ optional trailing tonal pill),
  optional subtitle, body, and a spaced stat row. Shared by History + Suggested
  stretches + Session-detail PR cards + Debug-panel readout.
- **dropdown_field** — an outlined form select (value/placeholder + expand_more caret).
  The editor forms' workhorse.
- **set_line** — a compact logged-set row (label · weight×reps · effort · ★), distinct
  from the editable 5-column `set_row`. (Session detail.)
- **value_stepper** — a full-width headline adjuster (filled round −, big string value
  with unit, filled round +). The prominent sibling of inline `stepper`. (Plate calc.)

## Fidelity work & bugs fixed this stretch

- **outlined_button parity bug.** Flutter's `alignment:center` made the button fill any
  bounded width (full-width in a column/Wrap) while the Kivy button hugged its label —
  a real cross-engine divergence. Fixed by adding `full_width` (default = hug label) to
  both kits; `full_width:true` stretches on both. Log-cardio's "When" updated to true.
- **progress_ring arc.** Pixel-verified (masking the purple button text that had
  contaminated the colour centroid) that both engines sweep clockwise from 12 o'clock
  by the same fraction — confirmed matching, not mirrored, despite the composite's
  optical illusion.
- Carets render via the shared Material icon (`expand_more`/`expand_less`), never a
  unicode glyph, so they can't go tofu or drift between engines.

## Known, tracked deltas (not silently shipped)

- **Colour emoji** → monochrome Material-icon stand-ins (warmup/cooldown/onboarding).
- A few omitted accessories: the Today/GymEditor FABs, per-row delete icons, top-bar
  favourite/overflow icons (top_bar carries a text action, not icon actions).
- The Kivy chip flow-gap is a touch wider than Flutter's Wrap spacing (cosmetic).

## Why it isn't fully mechanical (recorded for the open question)

A transpiler would *lower* (intent → primitives); this conversion *lifts* WFL's Compose
primitives up into kit intent. Recognising "this **is** a workout_row / info_card" is
pattern recognition, not syntax mapping — and a transpiler that *didn't* lift would
just reproduce WFL's primitives, defeating the kit. The grading is mechanical; the lift
is semantic. The most-mechanical path available is intent→intent: `WFL_PyHaxe/src/ui/`
holds every screen in Python against the *old* kit, so porting those skips the lift.

## Done — what's left is polish, not conversion

The full screen inventory is converted. Open follow-ups, all optional:

- **Promote 2-way → 3-way.** Screens 13–30 are Flutter↔Kivy source-faithful; capturing
  real-emulator references for the navigable ones would upgrade them to 3-way.
- **Tracked deltas to close if desired:** colour-emoji font (vs icon stand-ins), the
  handful of omitted accessories (FABs, per-row overflow/delete icons, top-bar icon
  actions), the nested-card-content width-coupling (check-in section borders), and the
  Kivy chip flow-gap. None block the thesis; each is a known, localized fix.
- **Mechanisation experiment:** port `WFL_PyHaxe/src/ui/` (old-kit Python screens) to
  the new kit to test the intent→intent path that skips the semantic lift.
